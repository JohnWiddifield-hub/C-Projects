Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted—so did Fang. The hooded figure
raised its head and looked right at Harry—unicorn blood was dribbling down its
front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry—he couldn’t move for fear.
Then a pain pierced his head like he’d never felt before, it was as though his scar was on fire – half-blinded, he staggered backwards. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and
something jumped clean over him, charging at the figure.
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a
minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone.
A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one
looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
“Are you alright?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
“Yes – thank you – what was that?”
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like
pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on
the scar which stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
