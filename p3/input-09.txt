I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was determined to go
down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage.
It was already late in the afternoon, although still warm and sunny. As I continued
to thread the tall woods, I could hear from far before me not only the continuous
thunder of the surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which
showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool draughts of air
began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the
grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling
and tossing its foam along the beach.
